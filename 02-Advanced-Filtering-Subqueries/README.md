# 02 - Advanced Filtering & Subqueries
This section demonstrates the ability to extract complex datasets using nested logic and advanced filtering predicates.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
* **Subqueries:** Implementing Scalar, Multi-value, and Correlated subqueries in `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses.
* **Set Operators:** Merging and comparing datasets using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.
* **Existence Checks:** Using `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` for efficient record validation.
